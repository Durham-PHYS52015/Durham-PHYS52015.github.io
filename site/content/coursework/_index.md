# Dense linear algebra in parallel

In this coursework you are to write parallel implementations of some
dense linear algebra operations, and benchmark the scaling
performance.

I provide a template file that contains input/output routines and
skeleton data structures. There are a number of functions that you
need to provide an implementation for.

We will implement a (simplified) case of a small number of the
parallel BLAS routines.
