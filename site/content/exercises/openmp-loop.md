# Parallelisation of a simple loop

As usual, we'll be running these exercises on Hamilton or COSMA, so
remind yourself of how to log in and transfer code [if you need
to]({{< ref hamilton-quickstart.md >}}).



## Obtaining the code

We're going to use the same code as we did in the previous
[vectorisation exercise]({{< ref vectorisation-loop.md >}}). You
should undo your edits from that exercise. If you can't remember what
you changed just [download]({{< code-ref add_numbers.tgz >}}) and
unpack the code again.

{{< details "Working from the repository" >}}
If you cloned the repository and have committed your changes on
branches for the previous exercises, just checkout the `main` branch
again and create a new branch for this exercise.
