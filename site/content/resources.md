# Other reading/resources

There are many excellent textbooks and tutorials on parallel
programming. Here are some I like, with brief commentary.

- Victor Eijkhout, [_Introduction to High Performance
  Computing_](https://pages02.tacc.utexas.edu/istc/istc.html). This is
  a gentle, and quite comprehensive, introduction to parallel
  computing. The author has a
  [separate](https://pages02.tacc.utexas.edu/pcse/html/index.html), in
  progress, book which contains more details on OpenMP and MPI
  programming models.
  
- Georg Hager & Gerhard Wellein, [_Introduction to High Performance
  Computing for Scientists and
  Engineers_](https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-High-Performance-Computing-for-Scientists-and-Engineers/Hager-Wellein/p/book/9781439811924),
  also available through the [Durham
  library](http://discover.durham.ac.uk/permalink/f/120t0fg/44DUR_LMS_DS.b27801512).
  This book is slightly heavier-going and has a focus on code
  optimisation and performance-modelling from the off. An annotated
  bibliography [is provided](https://blogs.fau.de/hager/hpc-book) by
  Georg Hager.

- [Bill Gropp](http://wgropp.cs.illinois.edu), one of the authors of
  the MPI standard, has a course on [designing and building
  applications for extreme scale
  systems](http://wgropp.cs.illinois.edu/courses/cs598-s16/index.htm).
  He covers performance models as well, and has a lot of good advice.

- [Matt Knepley's](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~knepley/) notes on
  [computational
  science](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~knepley/classes/caam519/CSBook.pdf)
  also have much good advice, with a focus on the use of
  [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) providing parallel data
  structures and solvers.

- The [Lawrence Livermore](https://www.llnl.gov) high performance
  computing [centre](https://hpc.llnl.gov/user-portal), has some nice
  [tutorials](https://hpc.llnl.gov/training/tutorials). Including one
  introducing [OpenMP](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/)
  and [one for MPI](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/).
  
- The UK's supercomputing service [ARCHER](https://www.archer.ac.uk/),
  ran regular training events over its lifetime. Much of their
  training material is
  [online](https://www.archer.ac.uk/training/online/), including some
  [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTxEcvOVT_Jd3iBC_kF_UqQ)
  of previous courses.
