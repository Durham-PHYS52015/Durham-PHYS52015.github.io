# Access to Hamilton

For many of the exercises in the course, we will be using the
[Hamilton](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/local/hpc/) supercomputer. You
should obtain an account on Hamilton by [following their
instructions](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/local/hpc/hamilton/account/#getting_account).

Since we'll be logging in a lot, I also provide some [tips]({{< ref
configuration.md >}}) on how to configure `ssh` for swifter login.
